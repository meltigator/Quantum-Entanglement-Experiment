🔬 Simulated Quantum Entanglement Experiment

Imagine having two twin particles. No matter how far apart they are—even at opposite ends of the universe—they remain mysteriously connected. If you interact with one, the other responds instantaneously, as if an invisible thread binds them. This is quantum entanglement, one of the most puzzling and fascinating phenomena in modern physics.

With this Bash-based experiment, you can experience the mystery of quantum connectivity through immersive visual and sound effects guiding you step by step.

🔹 What Is Quantum Entanglement?

Entanglement occurs when two particles share a quantum state, remaining correlated regardless of their distance. When one particle is measured, the other immediately assumes a corresponding value, seemingly violating classical locality and hinting at interactions that are not yet fully understood by physics.


⚛️ What Does This Script Do?

🔥 Creates entangled particles → The system generates two "particles" with correlated states (0 or 1). 

🌊 Quantum fluctuations → The particles oscillate in an undefined state before measurement. 

⚡ Wavefunction collapse → When measured, the particles’ states are fixed. 

🌀 Quantum decoherence → The wavefunction dissolves, transitioning into classical behavior. 

🔄 Quantum glitch → During collapse, visual and sound effects simulate coherence loss. 

✨ Probabilistic regeneration → The system may reconstruct itself and return to its original quantum state... or not!


🔊 Extra Effects

🎶 Dynamic sound effects, reminiscent of vintage computer sounds, representing quantum fluctuations. 

📡 Animated text to simulate oscillations and wavefunction collapse. 

🎭 User interaction to choose the level of quantum uncertainty, customizing the experiment.


🎬 Experiment Objective

This project is not a rigorous simulation of quantum mechanics, but rather an artistic and interactive representation that helps visualize fundamental concepts in a creative and engaging way.

The mystery of quantum mechanics remains far from being completely solved. But through this experience, you can get one step closer to grasping the strange reality of the quantum world. 🚀✨
